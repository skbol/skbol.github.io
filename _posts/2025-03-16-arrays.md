# Dynamic vs Static Arrays
**Static Arrays**
 - Cannot be resized i.e fixed in size (No instertion , appending, deletion)

**Dyanmic Arrays**
 - Can be resized.

**Here is a table,**

Operation  | Static Array   | Dynamic Array
----|--------|--------
Access | O(1)   | O(1)
Search | O(n) | O(n)
Insertion | NA    | O(n)
Appending | NA | O(n) -> O(1) Amortized
Deletion | NA | O(n)

### Time Complexity of Inserting and Appending in Arrays

The time complexity of **insertion** and **appending** in arrays depends on the operation's position. Let's analyze both cases.

### 1. Appending to an Array (End Insertion)
- In a **dynamic array** (like Python's `list`), appending an element is usually **O(1) amortized**.
- However, when the array reaches its capacity, it needs to **resize** (allocate a new larger array and copy elements over), which takes **O(n)** in that specific step.
- Since resizing happens **infrequently**, the **average time complexity remains O(1)**.

‚úÖ **For Python Lists**:  
Appending (`list.append(x)`) is **O(1) amortized**, but **O(n) worst-case** when resizing occurs.

---

### 2. Inserting in the Middle or Beginning
- Arrays store elements **contiguously** in memory, so inserting at any position **requires shifting elements**.
- If you insert at **index 0**, every element must shift to the right ‚Üí **O(n)**.
- If you insert at **index k**, elements from k to end must shift ‚Üí **O(n) in worst case**.

‚úÖ **For Python Lists**:  
`list.insert(index, value)` is **O(n) in worst case**, as elements need to shift.

---

### Summary Table

| Operation  | Static Array | Dynamic Array (Python `list`) |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Append (`arr.append(x)`) | ‚ùå Not Possible | O(1) amortized, O(n) worst-case (resizing) |
| Insert at End (`arr.insert(n, x)`) | O(1) | O(1) amortized |
| Insert at Beginning (`arr.insert(0, x)`) | O(n) | O(n) (shifting required) |
| Insert at Middle (`arr.insert(k, x)`) | O(n) | O(n) (shifting required) |

‚úÖ **Python lists are implemented as dynamic arrays**, so they follow the same complexity behavior.

# How Python Creates Lists Internally

Python **lists** are implemented using **dynamic arrays**, not linked lists. They behave like arrays in terms of indexing and storage but can grow dynamically.

## 1. Python Lists Use Dynamic Arrays
- Python lists use a **contiguous block of memory**, similar to **static arrays**.
- The size of a list is **not fixed**‚Äîit **expands dynamically** when needed.
- When you append an element and the list has no extra space, Python **allocates a larger array** and **copies the existing elements** into it.

## 2. Memory Allocation Strategy
- When a list is created, Python **allocates more memory than required** (extra space).
- The **exact growth pattern** follows a **geometric progression**:
  - When the list is full, it grows by a **factor of 1.125x to 1.5x** (depending on the implementation).
  - This ensures that appends are **O(1) amortized** rather than **O(n) every time**.

## 3. How Lists Grow
Here‚Äôs an example of how Python grows a list:

```python
import sys

arr = []
print(sys.getsizeof(arr))  # Size of an empty list

arr.append(1)
print(sys.getsizeof(arr))  # Increased size

arr.append(2)
arr.append(3)
arr.append(4)
print(sys.getsizeof(arr))  # Memory size grows before running out
```
You'll see that the memory size increases in chunks, not element-by-element


## 4. How Python Lists Handle Insertions
Since lists use contiguous memory, inserting elements in the middle or beginning requires shifting elements.
This makes list.insert(index, value) an O(n) operation in the worst case.
## 5. Why Not Use Linked Lists?
Python lists support fast random access (O(1)) using indexing.
Linked lists would require O(n) traversal for indexing.
Modern memory hardware is optimized for contiguous data, making arrays more cache-friendly.

## Conclusion
Python lists use dynamic arrays internally, meaning they:

- Allocate extra memory for future elements.
- Grow exponentially when needed.
- Allow fast appends (O(1) amortized).
- Require O(n) for insertions in the middle due to shifting.
- This design balances performance and flexibility, making Python lists efficient for most use cases. üöÄ

# Dynamic Arrays: How Python Expands Lists

Yes, a **dynamic array** is essentially a **static array with automatic resizing** when it gets full. When you append an element and the list is out of space, Python:

1. **Creates a new, larger static array.**
2. **Copies all elements from the old array to the new array.**
3. **Deletes the old array.**

## How Much Bigger Does It Expand?

Python's list expansion **does not double** in size like some other languages (e.g., Java‚Äôs `ArrayList`). Instead, Python uses a **growth factor of approximately 1.125x to 1.5x** based on the list's current size.

The exact growth pattern follows this formula:

\[
\text{New Capacity} = N + \frac{N}{8} + 6
\]

where **N** is the current size. This means that as lists grow larger, they expand more conservatively to save memory.

## Example Growth Pattern

Let's test how the size increases when appending elements:

```python
import sys

arr = []
prev_size = sys.getsizeof(arr)

for i in range(100):
    arr.append(i)
    new_size = sys.getsizeof(arr)
    if new_size != prev_size:
        print(f"Length: {len(arr)}, Memory Size: {new_size} bytes")
        prev_size = new_size
```

Output :
> Length: 0, Memory Size: 56 bytes  
> Length: 4, Memory Size: 88 bytes  
> Length: 8, Memory Size: 120 bytes  
> Length: 16, Memory Size: 184 bytes  
> Length: 25, Memory Size: 248 bytes  
> Length: 35, Memory Size: 344 bytes

## Why Not Double the Size?
- Memory Efficiency: Python avoids excessive memory usage by growing conservatively.
- Avoids Wasting Space: Doubling the size every time would lead to wasted memory for large lists.
- Fast Resizing: A 1.125x to 1.5x increase reduces the frequency of expensive copy operations.

## Final Takeaway
A dynamic array in Python is just a static array that expands intelligently when needed. The growth factor is around 1.125x to 1.5x, balancing memory usage and performance. üöÄ
