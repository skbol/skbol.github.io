## What is a Stack?
A stack is a one-ended linear data structure which models a real world stack by having two primary operations, namely push and	pop. (LIFO Model)

## When and where is a Stack used?	
- Used by undo mechanisms in text editors.	
- Used in compiler syntax checking for matching	
brackets and braces.	
- Can be used to model a pile of books or	plates.	
- Used behind the scenes to support recursion by	
keeping track of previous function calls	
- Can be used to do a Depth First Search (DFS) on a graph.	

## Complexity Analysis
> Assumes that stack is implemented using a LinkedList

Operation  | Singly Linked
----|--------
Pushing | O(1)
Popping | O(1)
Peeking | O(1)
Search | O(n)
Size | O(1) 

### Example usecase - Brackets
``` PusedoCode	
Let S be a stack	
For bracket in bracket_string:  	
    rev = getReversedBracket (bracket)	
If isLeftBracket (bracket): 	
    S. push (bracket)           	
Else If S.isEmpty() or S.pop() != rev:      	
    return false // Invalid     
return S.isEmpty()
```

### Example usecase - Towers of Hanoi

# **Comparison of Stack Implementation Using Different Data Structures**

A stack can be implemented using different data structures like **arrays (lists in Python)** and **linked lists**. Each has its own advantages and trade-offs in terms of **time complexity, space usage, and ease of implementation**.

---

## **1. Stack Using an Array (Python List)**

### ✅ **Pros**:
- **Easy to implement** (built-in list operations like `append()` and `pop()`).
- **Fast indexing** (direct access to elements via index).
- **Better cache locality** (faster access due to contiguous memory storage).

### ❌ **Cons**:
- **Fixed size in some languages** (though Python lists are dynamic).
- **Expensive resizing** (when exceeding allocated memory, Python creates a new larger array and copies elements).
- **Slower insertions & deletions at arbitrary positions** (but stacks only push/pop at the end).

### **Time Complexity**:

Operation | Time Complexity
----------|---------------
Push      | O(1)
Pop       | O(1)
Peek      | O(1)
Is Empty  | O(1)

---

## **2. Stack Using a Linked List**

> You can acheive a stack using a LL by initializing a "NULL" head.     
> Every time there is a "push" , insert it before the NULL i.e insert at head.      
> Every time there is a "pop" , move "head" to head.next

### ✅ **Pros**:
- **Dynamic size** (no need for resizing, unlike arrays).
- **Efficient memory usage** (no pre-allocation).
- **Fast insertions and deletions** (O(1) at the head).

### ❌ **Cons**:
- **Extra memory overhead** (each node stores a pointer/reference).
- **No direct indexing** (accessing an element requires traversal).
- **Poor cache locality** (nodes are scattered in memory).

### **Time Complexity**:
Operation | Time Complexity
----------|---------------
Push      | O(1)
Pop       | O(1)
Peek      | O(1)
Is Empty  | O(1)

---

## **3. Comparison Table**
Feature | **Array (List in Python)** | **Linked List**
--------|----------------|------------
**Memory Usage** | Higher due to resizing (in Python) | Lower per stack operation but extra memory per node
**Insertion/Deletion** | O(1) at end, O(n) in middle | O(1) at the top
**Indexing** | O(1) (direct access) | O(n) (traversal needed)
**Resizing Overhead** | Yes (Python dynamically resizes lists) | No (linked list grows dynamically)
**Cache Locality** | Good (contiguous memory) | Poor (nodes scattered in memory)
**Implementation Complexity** | Simple | Slightly complex

---

## **When to Use Which?**
- **Use an array-based stack (list)** when:
  - You need fast random access (`peek()`).
  - Memory overhead is a concern.
  - You want a simple implementation.
- **Use a linked-list-based stack** when:
  - You expect frequent push/pop operations and don't want resizing overhead.
  - Memory allocation for a large fixed-size array is inefficient.
  - You want dynamic growth without worrying about capacity.
