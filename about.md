Hello! I'm <span class="color-green">Srikanth Bolla.</span> &#128075;
I am an <span class="color-orange">Application Developer at IBM</span> &#128187; focused on <span class="color-orange">automating things with Python.</span> 🤖.
I enjoy designing efficient systems⚡, but when I’m not coding, I’m usually diving into the fascinating crossover of computer science 🖥️, physics ⚙️, and philosophy 📜.
Always exploring, always curious!.
